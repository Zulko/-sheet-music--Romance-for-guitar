ROMANCE FOR GUITAR
===================

Arrangement for piano of a piece for guitar by an unknown author (probably Fernando Sor, 1778-1839), made famous by the interpretation of Narciso Yepes in the soundtrack of the french movie Jeux Interdits (Forbidden Games).

Here is an interpretation of this arrangement:



This arrangement is licensed under a creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (see LICENCE.txt). In a nutshell, it is allowed to share
(copy, distribute, transmit), remix or adapt the work, and to make commercial use of the work, but "A. de la Marmotte" must be cited as
the original author if you do any of these things. That way I can see what my little arrangement is becoming :)

The sheet music is presented as a LilyPond_ file, ``romance.ly``. To compile it into a beautiful PDF file, you
